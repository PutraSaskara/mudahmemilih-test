                    As we live, our hearts turn colder. Cause pain is what we go through
                    as we become older. We get insulted by others, lose trust for those
                    others. We get back stabbed by friends. It becomes harder for us to
                    give others a hand. We get our heart broken by people we love, even
                    that we give them all...
